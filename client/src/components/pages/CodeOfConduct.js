        <p>
          We encourage our members to be their beautifully unique selves but also ask them to recognize and respect the program and its members. 
          The following codes of conduct are integral to fulfilling our mission of creating a welcoming and inclusive network for tech professionals of color. 
          There will be a zero-tolerance for those who do not abide by our codes, and anyone found violating any of the rules lists will be reprimanded, 
          which will be expressed in a verbal conversation and warning, and if deemed necessary, potentially escalate to expulsion from Black Tech Philly.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Be respectful - Facilitating a safe environment for tech professionals of color to meet, learn, network, and work together on projects is a 
          core value of Black Tech Philly. We ask that our members do not partake in any behavior that can be received as sexist, ageist,  racist, 
          homophobic, transphobic, xenophobia, or bigoted in any way shape, or form. Discrimination based on any of these things as well as offenses based 
          on the political or religious belief we will not be tolerated. Any member caught violating this rule will be addressed privately as a corrective measure, 
          and if deemed necessary will be removed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Conduct yourself with integrity and be considerate - Working collaboratively can be a very rewarding experience, but there are instances where some 
          engagements don’t work. The reasons can vary but Black Tech Philly takes a strong stance on protecting our members. 
          Bullying and threats of violence, gossip, unwelcome sexual advances, and harassment in any shape or form will not be tolerated. 
          If a member feels threatened we ask that you email the following address and report the incident.
