## Usage

## Features

- Events Calendar: Our events calendar is built using the Google Calendar as our CMS system, which allows us to
  conveniently schedule events from one account.

- Blog: Our blog is built using Strapi.js as our CMS.

## Todos

- Build fullfledge Calendar CMS. Our current Calendar is sufficent for the interim but ideally, we would like to have the capability to have a backlog of our events present on our site to show users the history of the things we do. Our current system does not allow for this.

- Comment section for blog: We would like to add the functionality to allow visitors to comment on posts.
